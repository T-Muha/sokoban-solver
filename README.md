# Application
Program and UI for a Sokoban solver
There are two versions available, one for those with Python and one for those without. Both kinds are available in the "version" folder located on this GitHub page.

# Running with Python
For those with Python, download the most recent version of the app as a folder from "version" on this GitHub page. Then, there are a series of packages you must install. It is highly reccomended to use a virtual environment such as Venv for the packages. I have also included the series of pip commands I used to install the packages in a Venv virtual environment. I know for sure that these commands install the correct package versions.

# Running without Python
For those without Python, there is an installer that will be available shortly. This is avaiable
